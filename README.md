## Introduction:
-In the kickoff of my analysis, I underscored the staggering number of reported accidents and fatalities in the UK during 2020. 
-My objective, centered around utilizing an SQL relational database, is to unearth the pivotal factors influencing road accidents and craft effective strategies to fortify road safety.

## Data Cleaning:
-The data cleaning phase showcases my meticulous approach to refining the accident dataset. 
-I meticulously tackled missing entries, with a particular focus on geographical and road-related columns. 
-The report delves into the intricacies of how I filled gaps and made necessary adjustments, ensuring the dataset's integrity for subsequent in-depth analysis.

## Analysis:
-As the analysis unfolds, I meticulously examined temporal patterns in accidents, unraveling intriguing spikes on Fridays and during specific hours.
-My scrutiny extended to motorcycle accidents, particularly those involving motorcycles over 50cc, revealing compelling patterns tied to both days of the week and specific timeframes.
-I dissected the relationships between motorcycle accidents and junction details, shedding light on critical risk factors.
-The investigation then shifted to pedestrian accidents, unveiling peak times and demographical nuances, especially concerning teenagers. Leveraging the Apriori algorithm, I probed into factors influencing accident severity.
-Outlier detection through the LOF method and region-specific k-means clustering enriched the depth of my analysis. 
-To predict accident severity, I crafted a stacking classifier, and the discerning outcomes are eloquently presented.

## Recommendations:
-My analytical journey culminated in actionable recommendations derived directly from the insights gleaned during the exhaustive analysis. 
-Proposals include fortifying law enforcement presence during peak accident times, collaborating with educational institutions for targeted awareness sessions, devising a real-time system for dynamic traffic updates, and harnessing the power of machine learning for predicting accident severity.
